# Obscura, Revelata

A practical application of [my guide for obscure commands.](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2598659064) This add-on includes a variety of menus you can use to manipulate default engine commands.

It is important to note that a lot of these commands are cheat flagged and will require `sv_cheats 1` to be used. Use in multiplayer, while not discouraged, could result in unforeseen effects. If at all possible, limit commands via an admin mod of your choosing.

Over time I will update/change certain commands included in the list. The media of the mod such as screenshots or videos will vary wildly over time. If you find any other obscure commands you want me to add, or want information on, post in the pinned feedback thread.
